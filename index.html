        <h2 class="topic-header">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="p-center">
          I am Cameron and both Kseniia and I are year 3 Digital Media students
          studying at the University of the West of England. As part of our
          final year studies, we will be working for the UWE in-house Design
          Enterprise Studio and have been granted an opportunity to work with a
          selection of predetermined clients for the purpose of designing and
          developing real world projects to add to our portfolios.
          <br /><br />
          We both decided to assist the Frome Valley Digital Trails team to
          design and develop a webapp that promotes exercise and educates users
          who journey through preplanned routes. Along the routes, the intent is
          for users to scan and "collect" QR codes on trees with their phones,
          opening the webapp which will contain information about the tree and
          surrounding habitat with audio and visual guides.

            alt="WinterBourne and Frome Valley Environmental Group. Frome Digital Trails"
          /><br />
          For our group roles, both Kseniia and I had already discussed our
          potential roles prior to the project and so comfortably moved into a
          design and developer role respectively. Despite this, we are both
          happy to help each other when needed and offer support. Since we are a
          two person group, there is no real leader figure within the group and
          so far we have discussed everything together before making decisions.
          <br /><br />
          Even though Kseniia has been the group member sending emails and the
          point of contact with the client, we made sure to introduce both of us
          and forward all emails to both members of the group. We also cowrite
          the emails to ensure that nothing important is left out. While this
          might not be efficient or effective in a much larger group, we feel
          that it works for us and ensures that we both know exactly what is
          going on at any given time.

        <h2 class="topic-header">Weeks 1-4: Preliminary Client Emails</h2>
        <p class="p-center">
          Having chosen to work with Frome Valley Winterbourne Trail, we emailed
          our client with a meeting agenda and several important questions about
          the project such as the intended audience and the prevalence of
          gamification in the web-app. <br /><br />

          Unfortunately, the client team was unable to arrange a meeting for the
          week commencing the 22nd October due to prior commitments. As such, we
          arranged a meeting for the 3rd November. <br /><br />
          This proved to be our first minor inconvenience as we were entirely
          reliant on the client and their team for any information that would
          let us start designing the webapp - but the team would be unavailable
          for at least a week.<br /><br />
          We also learnt the pitfalls of using email as the only form of
          communication - they tend to be checked far less often than messages
          on other platforms and so potentially days passed without a response
          even after the team's vacation week ended.

    <section class="topic" id="november">
      <article class="topic-box">
        <h2 class="topic-header">Week 1</h2>
        <p class="p-center">
          As alluded to in the previous entry, we had our first meeting with the
          client. This was our opportunity to lay out the main topics which
          would be required to set a full brief and begin working on the
          project. Though we had previously suggested using Zoom and meeting at
          midday, we ended up meeting half an hour earlier using Google.<br /><br />
          The meeting itself was quick and concise and both Kseniia and I were
          able to cover all the questions we had gathered. We learnt that the
          target audience would be a very broad range from toddlers to adults
          and is intended more so for those who wouldn't otherwise be going out
          and about.
          <br /><br />
          One thing we noted was just how open the project appeared to be; we
          were told that we are free to use more or less any mapping tool we
          want to for embedding purposes. What's more, the gamification aspects
          would require both a manual and automatic means of checking off
          locations. Automatic would be preferable and could potentially be
          linked to the QR codes, but manual would cover any potential errors or
          inconveniences.
          <br /><br />
          The prototype webapp will likely be lacking in content as we are
          reliant on the client to produce more content. We have an idea of what
          type of content will be used - audio guides for the entire route,
          drone footage, advised dress codes for the given route etc. But the
          client so far doesn't have a large stockpile of resources. This is
          manageable by using placeholders for the meantime.
          <br /><br />
          Lastly, following our concerns with the speed of email communication
          (or lack thereof), we asked the client if they would be happy to use
          slack. It turns out they already had a slack group for the project, so
          now we just have to wait to be invited.
        </p>

      <article class="topic-box">
        <h2 class="topic-header">Week 2</h2>
        <p>
          This week we were invited to our client's Slack group and were
          provided some more information about the content requirements of the
          site. We were also provided a link to the client's original website
          and made note of a few questions that would need to be answered before
          the web-app is designed.<br /><br />
          Firstly, the client's original documentation made mention of an app -
          but we were under the impression that we would be designing and
          developing a web-app, so clarification would be needed on that front.
          Secondly, we would need clarification on where exactly the required
          content would be stored - on the web-app, completely separate to the
          original website, or the original website itself. Thus we are unsure
          exactly how the website and web-app will be connected and if the
          web-app will simply be part of the existing website.<br /><br />
          Due to these questions, we began writing up a project brief outlining
          the must haves and should haves, technical and design requirements,
          but need these few questions to be answered before we can finalize the
          brief.

        <h2 class="topic-header">Week 3</h2>
        <p>
          On Tuesday we spoke with Jack about what we needed to complete next
          and were given some advice:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Competitor reference can be used more as a starting point even
            without actual competitors<br />
          </li>
          <li>Go into the next meeting with a recommendation on features</li>
          <li>
            Set an agenda based on meeting notes and sum it up conversationally
            after
          </li>
          <li>Create a mood-board</li>
          <li>Come up with functionality</li>
        </ul>
        With this in mind we scheduled a meeting for Wednesday and met with the
        client. We discussed the few remaining questions we had and received
        adequate answers for all of them. This included confirmation that the
        app could be a webapp and where the webapp might eventually be located.
        The client also agreed with both our recommendations: a) content be
        stored in the webapp itself rather than the client's website and b) use
        a mini quiz as part of the collectables feature.

          We wrote up a brief summing up all the points that we had agreed on
          during our meetings and posted it in the Frome Valley slack group for
          approval. We had positive responses and only one discussion point
          about a timeframe. We explained that we would be presenting during
          January but that we did not yet have a set date for the final
          deliverable.

          User journey maps were developed for a series of potential users to
          understand how they might want to use a digital trails webapp, their
          expectations and emotions when using it.

          Work began on the creation of low-fi wireframes alongside discussions
          on how the gamification aspects would interact with the design.
          Challenges involved containing all the potential content within a
          relatively small mobile centric design.
