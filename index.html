        <p class="p-center">
          I am Cameron and both Kseniia and I are year 3 Digital Media students
          studying at the University of the West of England. As part of our
          final year studies, we will be working for the UWE in-house Design
          Enterprise Studio and have been granted an opportunity to work with a
          selection of predetermined clients for the purpose of designing and
          developing real world projects to add to our portfolios.
          <br /><br />
          We both decided to assist the Frome Valley Digital Trails team to
          design and develop a webapp that promotes exercise and educates users
          who journey through preplanned routes. Along the routes, the intent is
          for users to scan and "collect" QR codes on trees with their phones,
          opening the webapp which will contain information about the tree and
          surrounding habitat with audio and visual guides.

            class="img-center"
            alt="WinterBourne and Frome Valley Environmental Group. Frome Digital Trails"
          /><br />
          For our group roles, both Kseniia and I had already discussed our
          potential roles prior to the project and so comfortably moved into a
          design and developer role respectively. Despite this, we are both
          happy to help each other when needed and offer support. Since we are a
          two person group, there is no real leader figure within the group and
          so far we have discussed everything together before making decisions.
          <br /><br />
          Even though Kseniia has been the group member sending emails and the
          point of contact with the client, we made sure to introduce both of us
          and forward all emails to both members of the group. We also cowrite
          the emails to ensure that nothing important is left out. While this
          might not be efficient or effective in a much larger group, we feel
          that it works for us and ensures that we both know exactly what is
          going on at any given time.

        <h2 class="topic-header">Weeks 1-4: Preliminary Client Emails</h2>
        <p class="p-center">
          Having chosen to work with Frome Valley Winterbourne Trail, we emailed
          our client with a meeting agenda and several important questions about
          the project such as the intended audience and the prevalence of
          gamification in the web-app. <br /><br />

          Unfortunately, the client team was unable to arrange a meeting for the
          week commencing the 22nd October due to prior commitments. As such, we
          arranged a meeting for the 3rd November. <br /><br />
          This proved to be our first minor inconvenience as we were entirely
          reliant on the client and their team for any information that would
          let us start designing the webapp - but the team would be unavailable
          for at least a week.<br /><br />
          We also learnt the pitfalls of using email as the only form of
          communication - they tend to be checked far less often than messages
          on other platforms and so potentially days passed without a response
          even after the team's vacation week ended.

        <p class="p-center">
          As alluded to in the previous entry, we had our first meeting with the
          client. This was our opportunity to lay out the main topics which
          would be required to set a full brief and begin working on the
          project.<br /><br />
