        <h2 class="topic-header">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="p-center">
          I am Cameron and both Kseniia and I are year 3 Digital Media students
          studying at the University of the West of England. As part of our
          final year studies, we will be working for the UWE in-house Design
          Enterprise Studio and have been granted an opportunity to work with a
          selection of predetermined clients for the purpose of designing and
          developing real world projects to add to our portfolios.
          <br /><br />
          We both decided to assist the Frome Valley Digital Trails team to
          design and develop a webapp that promotes exercise and educates users
          who journey through preplanned routes. Along the routes, the intent is
          for users to scan and "collect" QR codes on trees with their phones,
          opening the webapp which will contain information about the tree and
          surrounding habitat with audio and visual guides.
          <br /><br /><img

            class="img-center"
            alt="WinterBourne and Frome Valley Environmental Group. Frome Digital Trails"
          /><br />
          For our group roles, both Kseniia and I had already discussed our
          potential roles prior to the project and so comfortably moved into a
          design and developer role respectively. Despite this, we are both
          happy to help each other when needed and offer support. Since we are a
          two person group, there is no real leader figure within the group and
          so far we have discussed everything together before making decisions.
          <br /><br />
          Even though Kseniia has been the group member sending emails and the
          point of contact with the client, we made sure to introduce both of us
          and forward all emails to both members of the group. We also cowrite
          the emails to ensure that nothing important is left out. While this
          might not be efficient or effective in a much larger group, we feel
          that it works for us and ensures that we both know exactly what is
          going on at any given time.

        <h2 class="topic-header">Weeks 1-4: Preliminary Client Emails</h2>
        <p class="p-center">
          Having chosen to work with Frome Valley Winterbourne Trail, we emailed
          our client with a meeting agenda and several important questions about
          the project such as the intended audience and the prevalence of
          gamification in the web-app. <br /><br />

          Unfortunately, the client team was unable to arrange a meeting for the
          week commencing the 22nd October due to prior commitments. As such, we
          arranged a meeting for the 3rd November. <br /><br />
          This proved to be our first minor inconvenience as we were entirely
          reliant on the client and their team for any information that would
          let us start designing the webapp - but the team would be unavailable
          for at least a week.<br /><br />
          We also learnt the pitfalls of using email as the only form of
          communication - they tend to be checked far less often than messages
          on other platforms and so potentially days passed without a response
          even after the team's vacation week ended.
        </p>

    <section class="topic" id="november">
      <article class="topic-box">
        <h2 class="topic-header">Week 1</h2>
        <p class="p-center">
          As alluded to in the previous entry, we had our first meeting with the
          client. This was our opportunity to lay out the main topics which
          would be required to set a full brief and begin working on the
          project. Though we had previously suggested using Zoom and meeting at
          midday, we ended up meeting half an hour earlier using Google.<br /><br />
          The meeting itself was quick and concise and both Kseniia and I were
          able to cover all the questions we had gathered. We learnt that the
          target audience would be a very broad range from toddlers to adults
          and is intended more so for those who wouldn't otherwise be going out
          and about.
          <br /><br />
          One thing we noted was just how open the project appeared to be; we
          were told that we are free to use more or less any mapping tool we
          want to for embedding purposes. What's more, the gamification aspects
          would require both a manual and automatic means of checking off
          locations. Automatic would be preferable and could potentially be
          linked to the QR codes, but manual would cover any potential errors or
          inconveniences.
          <br /><br />
          The prototype webapp will likely be lacking in content as we are
          reliant on the client to produce more content. We have an idea of what
          type of content will be used - audio guides for the entire route,
          drone footage, advised dress codes for the given route etc. But the
          client so far doesn't have a large stockpile of resources. This is
          manageable by using placeholders for the meantime.
          <br /><br />
          Lastly, following our concerns with the speed of email communication
          (or lack thereof), we asked the client if they would be happy to use
          slack. It turns out they already had a slack group for the project, so
          now we just have to wait to be invited.
        </p>

      <article class="topic-box">
        <h2 class="topic-header">Week 2</h2>
        <p>
          This week we were invited to our client's Slack group and were
          provided some more information about the content requirements of the
          site. We were also provided a link to the client's original website
          and made note of a few questions that would need to be answered before
          the web-app is designed.<br /><br />
          Firstly, the client's original documentation made mention of an app -
          but we were under the impression that we would be designing and
          developing a web-app, so clarification would be needed on that front.
          Secondly, we would need clarification on where exactly the required
          content would be stored - on the web-app, completely separate to the
          original website, or the original website itself. Thus we are unsure
          exactly how the website and web-app will be connected and if the
          web-app will simply be part of the existing website.<br /><br />
          Due to these questions, we began writing up a project brief outlining
          the must haves and should haves, technical and design requirements,
          but need these few questions to be answered before we can finalize the
          brief.

          On Tuesday we spoke with Jack about what we needed to complete next
          and were given some advice:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Competitor reference can be used more as a starting point even
            without actual competitors<br />
          </li>
          <li>Go into the next meeting with a recommendation on features</li>
          <li>
            Set an agenda based on meeting notes and sum it up conversationally
            after
          </li>
          <li>Create a mood-board</li>
          <li>Come up with functionality</li>
        </ul>
        With this in mind we scheduled a meeting for Wednesday and met with the
        client. We discussed the few remaining questions we had and received
        adequate answers for all of them. This included confirmation that the
        app could be a webapp and where the webapp might eventually be located.
        The client also agreed with both our recommendations: a) content be
        stored in the webapp itself rather than the client's website and b) use
        a mini quiz as part of the collectables feature.

          We wrote up a brief summing up all the points that we had agreed on
          during our meetings and posted it in the Frome Valley slack group for
          approval. We had positive responses and only one discussion point
          about a timeframe. We explained that we would be presenting during
          January but that we did not yet have a set date for the final
          deliverable.

          Holidays break week + website creation begins. I began exploring how
          the current Frome Valley website was created and discovered that it
          was styled using Tailwind, which functions similarly to Bootstrap but
          in theory allows for greater control of styling. <br />
          As such I researched into and installed Tailwind into a starter
          repository, copied over the html from one of the pre-existing Frome
          Valley pages and deconstructed it. This means that the Digital Trails
          page would keep design consistency with the rest of the website,
          hopefully removing nagivagion frustrations from users. <br /><br />
          With an newfound understanding of Tailwind and the Frome Valley site,
          I opened up Kseniia's wireframe designs and began implementing them
          into the base site. Much of the troubles came down to not knowing the
          exact Tailwind class names required, but thankfully there is an
          extremely useful online
          <a href="https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/">"cheat sheet"</a>
          available. <br /><br />

          The next important decision was how to properly showcase extra
          information for each point. This is one of the main draws for the
          webapp - users can learn more about interesting nature points along
          the routes. Currently, modal/lightboxes are being considered as they
          bypass the need for additional html pages within each route for every
          single point - but that might become necessary once QR code scans are
          considered. Research will need to be made into the limits of opening
          webpages via a QR link.

          During this period, we focused on gathering and presenting all our
          findings until this point. We implemented the modal design and
          discussed our considerations for the post hand-over period during the
          client presentation. The client seemed happy overall with our progress
          and asked questions about the number of planned routes and potential
          post-launch support. As this had been established in our design brief,
          we re-iterated our plan for a fully working pilot route and templates
          for the team to make more in the future.

          Following the presentation, Kseniia began reworking the home page
          prototype in Figma. Meanwhile, I implemented a working carousel system
          and further researched potential options for showcasing information.
          As part of this process, we messaged the client on slack with our
          research and proposed two main solutions - giving preference for the
          second. This solution would involve creating a separate webpage for
          each individual route point rather than implementing a more complex
          javascript based solution.

          This week we took on feedback about the Figma design and made a note of considerations and changes to follow:
          <ul>
            <li>Make some variations on the colour schemes</li>
            <li>Keep all buttons the same colour tot encourage interaction and establish consistency</li>
            <li>The logo could be slightly bigger</li>
            <li>Font sizes are too large - consider mobile design guidelines</li>
            <li>Condense the amount of text by using icons - more visuals</li>
            <li>Develop an icon set for the walks and each point (consider what style the icons will be)</li>

        <p>This week I (Kseniia) continued working on the prototype for the web app. According to the feedback, the colour pallete was corrected in order to make it more simple and consistent. The sizes of some of the elements, such as the logo and text, were adjusted to fit the mobile phone screens better. 
          <br><br>Furthermore, I designed the rest of the pages for the route points and used the content given by the client to fill them in. In the meantime, Cameron continued working on the web app and started implementing the design of the prototype to it. Progress with using local storage for the project has also been made. </p>

        <p>I continued finishing the prototype by adjusting some of the design elements. Next, I combined the progress and route points sections together in order to optimize the space on the screen. I have also moved the route information text to the top of the page above the map so that it is more accessible for the user. 
          <br><br>Cameron continued working on the web app and implemented the design for the route and points pages according to the amended hi-fi prototype. Image carousels have been added and styled and work began on implementing the quiz functionality using local storage. </p><br>

        <p>This week, I have contacted the client to give them an update on the progress that has been made so far, as well as get their approval for the design of the Figma prototype of the web app. I have informed them that Cameron is currently in the process of coding the web app and that the project is on track. I also asked the client to provide us with more content, such as images and text, if possible in order to improve the project even more. The design of the prototype has been approved and the client was very happy with it, so the work on the web app continued. We were also given a new map to embed into the current route page, instead of the one that we were using before. <br> <br>

We have also discussed the situation with the QR codes, as the client was wondering if it is possible to use the same QR code for various routes in order to save money. We have explained that it is not possible to use the same QR code for 2 routes, however, we offered a solution that involves cycling through live routes (changing the content and the route on the page linked to the QR code).
<br><br>
Furthermore, Cameron continued working on coding the web app this week and has focused on creating the quiz at the end of the information page. He successfully managed to create the quiz, which rewards the user with a sticker, when answered correctly.</p>

          During the first two weeks of March, we continued working on the web app. Cameron added the second route point (Worrells Oak) to the webapp with all of the given content and pictures, as well as made the second quiz and sticker reward. The design of the actual web app was also adjusted to better fit the one in the prototype, which was approved by the client last week.<br /> <br />

Furthermore, once all of the work was done, the link to the webapp was sent through Slack to the client for approval. We were told by the client that the web app is exactly what they wanted and fits their brief well. They also mentioned that the project is on track and they are happy with it. We also asked the client for more content to add to the webapp and if they wanted more routes points added to the current route, so that it will be easier for them to change and add more information in the future. We agreed to have 12 points in total for the current route.

          As we are getting closer to the deadline for the project, we were focusing on finishing everything up for the final hand-in to the client. As I was working on the UX Design part for this project, I have spent these weeks on finishing all of the necessary documentation and files and putting it all together. Cameron was preparing for the final hand-in by creating a template with instructions for the client that they can later use to add more routes and points to the web app. Furthermore, we have made a showcase video, that explains how the webapp was created and the process we went through, as well as the final result. We have also started writing our professional documentation for the final submission.
